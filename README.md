Motivation
----------

This repository is an easy access point for storing MacOSX language tools. I share these tools because they make life easier for other people seeking to learn a foreign language. In particular the tools are useful if one is learning Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese.


Setup Guide
-----------

I provide a setup guide with detailed steps that show how to configure these tools on Mac OSX 10.9.3. I believe the setup remains the same on 10.8-10.9+ but there is no guarantee and because of my schedule I cannot actively support updating the guide. If you find something useful please post it and I will update periodically or simply fork the files and update as needed.

How to Use
----------

Using these tools one is able to select Chinese text and hear Beijing Mandarin by typing Control-Z, Taiwanese Mandarin - Control-X, or Cantonese (Control-C). Other functionality includes converting Chinese Text to pinyin and seeing a Quick Lookup of Pinyin for the selected text.
